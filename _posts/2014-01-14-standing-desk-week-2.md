My reflections on week two of the [28-day stand up and work challenge][week 1].

## Observations: week two

[Day 6][], 72 minutes. Committing to doing a few seconds of stretching before and/or after each standing session to fight fatigue and tightness.

[Day 7][], 84 minutes. Instead of getting tired of standing today, I got tired of sitting and spent some extra time standing.

[Day 8][], 96 minutes. Time goes by pretty quickly during standing periods. Long sessions donâ€™t feel long anymore.

[Day 9][], 108 minutes. Noticed a tendency to stand with my feet too close together, which hinders good hip and back posture.

[Day 10][], 120 minutes. Last week I became more aware of bad habits, discomfort, etc., while sitting. As the amount of seated time decreases, and as seated posture hopefully improves, sitting is starting to feel OK again.

## Next week

As the daily standing periods reach up to three hours total, it will be necessary to think about making a more regular daily routine of switching between sitting and standing.
