What makes a blog wither and die? I have made several attempts at blogging; this most recent attempt sat around for over a year with [no activity][]. After an initial burst of posts about [using a standing desk][standing], it felt like I had nothing to write about, and soon the blog slipped off my list of priorities and lay dormant.

Now, a year later, I am rebooting this with the intention to make it work. I come equipped with what I think was missing previously: focus, a voice, a specific idea of an audience, a willingness to "ship" without fretting about perfection, and a queue of ideas. Underneath all that is a clearer idea of *why* I want to write.

## A new direction

This blog has a new name: **Running\|Code**. Reflecting that title, it will (more or less) follow a specific theme: the increasing overlap of my running pursuits and programming career.

I think about running when I code, and I come up with code ideas when I run. As I get more serious about trail and ultra running, the discipline of training is improving my work habits. And my [programming work][TrailsRoc-app] has helped to expand my involvement in the local running community and is improving my training. I think this can amount to an interesting perspective with which to write.

## The right tools

An email series from my former colleague [John Sonmez][simpleprogrammer] called ["Create a Blog That Boosts Your Career"][blog-course] got me motivated and organized to do all this. As I mentioned, I am making a much more intentional effort at the writing this time around, thanks in part to this course. Check this out if you have any interest in writing online: it doesn't just cover the basics of creating a blog, it shows step-by-step how to become consistent and effective and how to build an audience.

## Follow along
