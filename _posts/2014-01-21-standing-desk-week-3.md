title: "Standing Desk Challenge: Week Three"

This is the third week of my belated participation in the [28-Day Stand Up and Work Challenge][challenge]. Check the entry from [week one][] for an introduction to this series of posts.

## Observations: week three

[Day 11][], 132 minutes. [Last week][], I divided standing time into two sessions per day; this week, I split the standing time into three shorter periods, to keep each session under one hour.

[Day 12][], 144 minutes. With each standing session being under one hour in duration, it’s been over a week since I felt significant soreness or fatigue while standing, and seated periods are broken up enough that they are producing less discomfort.

[Day 13][], 156 minutes. Lost track of time and missed 20 minutes of standing time. To compensate, I stood at the kitchen table that evening while checking email. We really should be just as conscious about our posture and sitting/standing behaviors in the evening as we are during the work day.

[Day 14][], 168 minutes. Playing music while standing helps to encourage moving around a little more.

[Day 15][], 180 minutes. Lost track of time again and missed out on an hour of standing. Being busy with phone calls or urgent work is not an excuse to skip a standing session, especially when it only takes a minute to switch positions.

### The value of good peripherals

When using a laptop computer, a standing desk setup clearly requires an external keyboard. I have a [Das Keyboard, Model S Ultimate][Das Keyboard]. Besides being a general joy to use, I have a theory that it encourages good posture. To personify this keyboard: it *wants* to be used optimally, two hands on the home row, forearms level, touch typing<sup id="back-1"><a href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup>. Mechanical key switches feel best to me when pressed lightly, at the right angle, with a certain rhythm. For me, the sum of these effects is a straight back and a relaxed pose.

## Next week

[Next week][], as the standing sessions reach a total of four hours per day, I want to set a schedule for three standing sessions daily and commit to following that schedule. In the long run, a rigid daily schedule is probably not necessary, but following one for several days may help to instill a routine.
